        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This is the first template to work with both HTML and CSS and improve this page.</p>
        <p>The future of artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to be transformative across various sectors, with the potential to significantly enhance productivity, revolutionize healthcare, personalize experiences, and drive innovation at an accelerated pace; however, concerns regarding job displacement, ethical considerations, and the need for responsible development remain crucial aspects to address as AI continues to evolve. .</p>
        <p id="student-intro">Just a few years back, if you had been told that by 2024, you would be able to have a conversation with a computer that would seem almost completely human, would you have believed it?

            So what do you think AI will be capable of in ten, twenty or even fifty years’ time?
            
            Of course, it’s impossible to predict for sure – but it seems a fairly safe bet that many things that seem entirely impossible today will be a part of everyday life.
            
            By now, it’s clear that AI is the great breakthrough technology of our times. And as with other breakthrough technologies – fire, steam power, electricity, computing – now it exists, it is only going to continue to evolve and become more capable..</p>
