        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>AI has increasingly become a powerful tool in stock analysis, using machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of market data. By processing patterns and historical trends, AI can identify potential investment opportunities more quickly and accurately than traditional methods. It can predict stock price movements, offering traders insights that would otherwise take human analysts much longer to uncover.AI has increasingly become a powerful tool in stock analysis, using machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of market data.

        <p>Machine learning models and neural networks help AI improve over time, adjusting their strategies based on new data and market conditions. These models can adapt to different market environments, providing real-time forecasts that assist investors in making better decisions. This adaptability makes AI especially useful for volatile markets, where predictions can change rapidly.</p>
