        <h2> <div style="background-color: lightgray;" </div> Introduction</h2>
            <div style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;" </div><p id="student-intro"><b>Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. These models are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language with remarkable accuracy and fluency. LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, enabling them to grasp the intricacies of language, context, and meaning. There are several types of LLMs, each with its own unique characteristics and applications. Some of the most notable types include:</b> 
        <li> Transformers: These models, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), have revolutionized the way language models are built. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to process input text, allowing them to understand and generate coherent sentences.</li>

    <li> Models: These models, including the likes of T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer), are designed for tasks that involve transforming one sequence of text into another, such as translation or summarization. They are trained to handle input and output sequences of variable lengths.</li>
            
<li> Encoder-Decoder Models: These models, like the Transformer-based encoder-decoder architectures, are particularly effective for tasks that require a deep understanding of context, such as machine translation and text generation. They consist of an encoder that processes the input text and a decoder that generates the output text.</li>
            
<li> Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Although less commonly used in modern LLMs, RNNs, and their variants like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units), have been fundamental in the development of language models. They are designed to handle sequential data and have been widely used for tasks like speech recognition and language modeling.</li>
            
<li> Masked Language Models: Models like BERT fall under this category, where portions of the input text are masked during training. The model learns to predict the masked portions, enabling it to develop a deep understanding of language semantics and syntax. </li>
